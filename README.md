# Multimodel-Image-classification-of-Art-forms
Multimodal image classification of art forms using different models involves leveraging various machine learning or deep learning models to identify and categorize different art styles, forms, and genres based on image data. In this context, you would typically use a combination of different models (e.g., CNNs, transformers, or even hybrid approaches) to process and classify images from different art forms.
